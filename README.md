# Project 1 Data Scraping and Analysis

# Requirements
- python anaconda installation
- a dawson oracle database

# Description
The project lets you analyze the content of the dawson subreddit by searching frequent keywords 
from the subreddit's posts and comments using NLTK. With the collected keywords, it makes analytical charts using matplotlib
to support evidence for the analysis report.

# Setup
Users should run the main.py file and enter their DB credentials in order to create the DB tables.
The graphs will be generated one at a time and the next graph is generated once the page is closed
